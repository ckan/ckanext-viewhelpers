ckanext-viewhelpers
===================

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/ckan/ckanext-viewhelpers.svg)

This extension adds a few helper methods that are useful for CKAN's views. It
uses the new Resource View developed in
https://github.com/ckan/ckan/tree/1251-resource-view.

Installation
------------

To use it, simply clone this repository and run ```python setup.py install```.
Then add ```viewhelpers``` to your ```ckan.plugins``` in your CKAN config file.
Make sure you add it before the other plugins that depend on it.

Finally, restart your webserver. The helpers are now available for the other
plugins.

Usage
-----

### Filters

When building a visualization, it's often useful to allow users to filter
the data shown, so they can focus on what's more important to them.

We defined a filtering scheme inspired on [OpenSpending](//openspending.org).
First I'll explain how it works, and then I'll point you to examples where you
can learn how to use it in your visualizations. Say that you have this dataset:

| Country | Forest area (% of land area) | Year |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---- |
| Brazil  | 68.0                         | 1990 |
| Brazil  | 66.2                         | 1995 |
| Brazil  | 64.5                         | 2000 |
| Brazil  | 62.7                         | 2005 |
| Brazil  | 61.4                         | 2010 |
| USA     | 32.4                         | 1990 |
| USA     | 32.6                         | 1995 |
| USA     | 32.8                         | 2000 |
| USA     | 33.0                         | 2005 |
| USA     | 33.2                         | 2010 |
| ...     | ...                          | ...  |

This is just a snippet of the dataset. It has data for every country, from 1980
until 2013. Plotting all this data in a single chart (say a line chart)
wouldn't be very useful. You have to filter.

Our filtering works by adding a `filters` parameter to the URL's query string.
For example, if you wanted to see the data just from Brazil, you'd do:

`?filters=Country:Brazil`

> To keep it short, I'm just showing the query string, but keep in mind that
> there's the whole > URL before that (i.e.
> `http://demo.ckan.org/dataset/world-bank/resource/b395830e-8848-4e18-84b2-43dsaf4359`)

What if I wanted both Brazil and USA (but nothing else)?

`?filters=Country:Brazil|Country:USA`

What if I wanted Brazil and USA, but only on 1990 and 2010?

`?filters=Country:Brazil|Country:USA|Year:1990|Year:2010`

In general, the filters are defined as `Key:Value` pairs separated by `|`
(pipes). If you have multiple filters on the same key, it works as a logical
`OR` (i.e. `Country == "Brazil" OR Country == "USA"`). If you have multiple
filters defined on different keys, it works as a logical `AND` (i.e. `Country
== "Brazil" AND Year == "1990"`).

#### Who's using it?

To see how this is used in real extensions, check
[ckanext-dashboard](//github.com/ckan/ckanext-dashboard),
[ckanext-basiccharts](//github.com/ckan/ckanext-basiccharts), and
[ckanext-mapviews](//github.com/ckan/ckanext-mapviews).

If you have any doubts, the code itself should be relatively easy to follow.
The JavaScript tests might help as well.

### Filters' form

![Filters form](doc/filters_form.png)

When creating your visualization as a CKAN's resource view, you might want to
allow the user to define default forms. For example, a user might want to create
multiple bar charts on the same resource, each showing a part of the data.

To help you create the form allowing the user to do that, we've created the
`filters_form` CKAN module. Currently it's still under heavy development, and
the Jinja macros used to make it look like the screenshot above weren't moved
to this repository yet (there's an issue for that at
[#4](//github.com/ckan/ckanext-viewhelpers/issues/4)).

You can see how it was done in
[ckanext-basiccharts](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-basiccharts/blob/master/ckanext/basiccharts/theme/templates/basechart_form.html). If you want (or does) use it on your resource view, please ping me in the aforementioned issue.
